He lives in Rhode Island and spends his time performing, teaching and conducting research around the world. He is an author of 4 books, 3 of which are translations of Telugu and Sanskrit texts; and the latest book that came out this March is a critical biography of Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara, called RAYA. Srinivas is a professional concert sitarist and has given numerous recitals in the US, India and Europe. He has three albums to his credit: GITA (1999), Sitar &amp; Tabla (2001) and Hemant &amp; Jog (2008).</p><p>This episode is more in the realms of spirituality, in the context of South Asian philosophy and the Bhagavad Gita. We discuss some of his favourite verses and chapters from the Gita, about the deep underlying wisdom, and how we can make sense of them in todayâ€™s day and age. I ask him about his thoughts on religion, consciousness, meditation, his passion for music and much more. He also talks about how India never really recovered from colonialisation and how the quest for adoption of Western ideologies has left us devoid of any appreciation for our cultural heritage, and how unconditioning ourselves is the first step in moving forward on our spiritual path.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
