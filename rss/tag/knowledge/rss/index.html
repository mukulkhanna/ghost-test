He is a Senior Fellow in the Wharton School’s Management Department. He is a winner of four awards for investigative journalism and author of three books, Pandya has more than 30 years of experience as a writer and editor. His articles have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, The Economist and other publications. He holds a master’s degree in economics from the University of Bombay.</p><p>We talk about many things - about his journey, his beginnings, the story of Knowledge@Wharton, about his experiences of interviewing legends like Adam Grant, the founder of Intel and Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, about the importance and drawbacks of technology in the conquest for knowledge, about figuring out the right balance and utilising technology to exceed our abilities, about the core values that would be of utmost importance in the coming decades of unprecedented transformations caused by automation and AI, and about what he feels is the most important aspect of being a successful leader.</p><p>In the end, Mukul sir also shares some beautiful advice for individuals that seek to learn and share knowledge. Mukul sir is an absolute gentleman, probably the most humble, down-to-earth person I have ever come across.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
