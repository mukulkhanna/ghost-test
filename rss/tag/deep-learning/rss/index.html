His interesting background includes a PhD in Quantum Physics and a degree in Law, followed by a five-year long career as a Patent Attorney, before his passion for Science brought him to HuggingFace. Thomas, and his team at HuggingFace believes in the power of Open Source and have been active contributors on Github, sharing their research and progress, allowing the development of technology for the better.</p><p>In this episode, we talk about his diverse career background- his journey from Physics to Law to Deep Learning and Conversational Agents. We also talk about the vision at HuggingFace, the challenges in building a long-term, companion-like Conversational Agent, the state of Natural Language Processing, and how we can do better.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DNN1: HDR Imaging & DL for Computer Vision // Shanmuga Raman]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" title="Spotify Embed: DNN 1: Deep Learning for Computer Vision, Computational Photography &amp; HDR imaging | Shanmuganathan Raman" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/6d2EFs6Lke0gW4UMJj5jpO"></iframe></figure><p>In the first episode of the Deep Neural Notebooks podcast, I talk with Dr. Shanmuganathan Raman, who is an Associate Professor of Electrical &amp; Computer Science Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar.

He has been my mentor for my research internship at IIT. He has obtained his MTech and PhD degrees from IIT Bombay and was a post-doc research associate at Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. His PhD thesis on â€˜Low Dynamic Range solution to High Dynamic Range Imaging problemâ€™ received the IIT Bombay Excellence in PhD Thesis Workâ€™ Award. His research interests include Computer Vision, Computational Photography, Machine Learning and Computer Graphics.</p><p>In this episode we discuss his educational background, his theses, the state of HDR imaging and computational photography. We also talk about deep learning, the scope of traditional algorithms in a DL-minded society and the road ahead.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
