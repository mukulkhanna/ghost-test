He specializes in imaging and data: sheet music, scientific visualization, astronomy, biomedical data and software telemetry. He started his Open Source journey around 2007, contributing to Matplotlib, while he was a Senior Computer Scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute. He later went on to become a lead developer of Matplotlib, carrying on the vision of Matplotlibâ€™s original author, John Hunter.</p><p>In this episode, we talk about his beginnings - his education in Computersâ€™ and Music, his experience in Astronomy, working at the Space Telescope Science Institute and how he got into contributing to Open Source for Matplotlib. We also talk about his role at Mozilla, the importance of data privacy and the amazing project that he is currently working on - Pyodide, an Open Source tool to empower Data Science in the Browser. Michael also shares some advice for beginners trying to get into Data Science and communities just starting out with Open Source software.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DNN2: Conversational AI, NLP & HuggingFace ðŸ¤— // Thomas Wolf]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" title="Spotify Embed: DNN 2: HuggingFace, Conversational AI &amp; Deep Learning | From Quantum Physics to Chatbots | Thomas Wolf" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2EUSdtVvv17DaMI5iSw3jp"></iframe></figure><p>In the second episode of Deep Neural Notebooks, I talk with Thomas Wolf.</p><p>Thomas is the Chief Science Officer at HuggingFace, a Brooklyn based start-up that aims at building the first truly social artificial intelligence.

His interesting background includes a PhD in Quantum Physics and a degree in Law, followed by a five-year long career as a Patent Attorney, before his passion for Science brought him to HuggingFace. Thomas, and his team at HuggingFace believes in the power of Open Source and have been active contributors on Github, sharing their research and progress, allowing the development of technology for the better.</p><p>In this episode, we talk about his diverse career background- his journey from Physics to Law to Deep Learning and Conversational Agents. We also talk about the vision at HuggingFace, the challenges in building a long-term, companion-like Conversational Agent, the state of Natural Language Processing, and how we can do better.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
