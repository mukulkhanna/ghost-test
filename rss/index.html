He is also a Data Scientist at Waymo (formerly the Google Self Driving Car Project). His research specialises in Reinforcement Learning (RL), Cooperative Multi-Agent RL, to be precise.</p><p>So this interview is all in the context of Reinforcement Learning. We talk about his journey - how he started with Machine Learning &amp; RL. I ask him about his thoughts on the state of RL - about how the field has progressed and changed since he started, about how it has become so popular in the last few years, and about the challenges being faced.</p><p>We also talk about his research at Waymo, about recent projects from his lab, and about the scope and future of telepresence robots, one of which was developed under his guidance. We also talk about the infamous Reward Hypothesis in the context of RL and Philosophy. In the end, he also shares some advice for people starting out with RL.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DNN 6: Spirituality, Music & The Bhagavad Gita // Srinivas Reddy]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" title="Spotify Embed: DNN 6: Spirituality, Music &amp; The Bhagavad Gita | Srinivas Reddy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/6SJ7z5gavxGR9zaPFJkwCs"></iframe></figure><p>In the sixth episode of the Deep Neural Notebooks podcast, I interview Professor, Author, Sitarist and Composer, Srinivas Reddy.</p><p>He is a Guest Professor of South and Southeast Asian Studies at IIT Gandhinagar and Visiting Assistant Professor of Religious Studies and Contemplative Studies at Brown University.

He lives in Rhode Island and spends his time performing, teaching and conducting research around the world. He is an author of 4 books, 3 of which are translations of Telugu and Sanskrit texts; and the latest book that came out this March is a critical biography of Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara, called RAYA. Srinivas is a professional concert sitarist and has given numerous recitals in the US, India and Europe. He has three albums to his credit: GITA (1999), Sitar &amp; Tabla (2001) and Hemant &amp; Jog (2008).</p><p>This episode is more in the realms of spirituality, in the context of South Asian philosophy and the Bhagavad Gita. We discuss some of his favourite verses and chapters from the Gita, about the deep underlying wisdom, and how we can make sense of them in todayâ€™s day and age. I ask him about his thoughts on religion, consciousness, meditation, his passion for music and much more. He also talks about how India never really recovered from colonialisation and how the quest for adoption of Western ideologies has left us devoid of any appreciation for our cultural heritage, and how unconditioning ourselves is the first step in moving forward on our spiritual path.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DNN:5 Neuroscience, Art and Creativity // Leslee Lazar]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" title="Spotify Embed: DNN 5: Neuroscience, Art &amp; Creativity | Leslee Lazar" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/4TuU8kZBCM2KWevHBAbpNj?si=y8WPdB7DQBC90o4ofgGvqA"></iframe></figure><p>In this episode, I interview Leslee Lazar, a cognitive neuroscientist and visual artist.</p><p>He is a professor at IIT Gandhinagar, at the Centre for Cognitive and Brain Science, working on processing of tactile perception in the somatosensory cortex of the brain.

He specializes in imaging and data: sheet music, scientific visualization, astronomy, biomedical data and software telemetry. He started his Open Source journey around 2007, contributing to Matplotlib, while he was a Senior Computer Scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute. He later went on to become a lead developer of Matplotlib, carrying on the vision of Matplotlibâ€™s original author, John Hunter.</p><p>In this episode, we talk about his beginnings - his education in Computersâ€™ and Music, his experience in Astronomy, working at the Space Telescope Science Institute and how he got into contributing to Open Source for Matplotlib. We also talk about his role at Mozilla, the importance of data privacy and the amazing project that he is currently working on - Pyodide, an Open Source tool to empower Data Science in the Browser.
